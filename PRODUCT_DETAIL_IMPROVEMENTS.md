# Product Detail Page Improvements - Complete Report

## 🎯 Overview
This document outlines all the improvements made to the product details page based on user requirements. All requested features have been successfully implemented and tested.

## ✅ Backend Fixes

### 1. Fixed jdatetime Module Error
**Problem**: `ERROR Error adding product comment: No module named 'jdatetime'`

**Solution**:
- Added `jdatetime==4.1.0` to `requirements.txt`
- Installed the package using `pip install --break-system-packages jdatetime==4.1.0`
- The comment functionality now works perfectly with Persian date formatting

### 2. Updated Weight-Based Pricing Logic
**Problem**: Incorrect pricing multipliers for different weight options

**Solution**:
- ✅ 500g = 2x base price (was 1.8x, now correctly 2x)
- ✅ 1kg = 4x base price (correctly implemented)
- The JavaScript pricing logic in lines 1284-1290 now uses the correct multipliers:
  ```javascript
  const weightMultipliers = {
      '250g': 1,    // Base price
      '500g': 2,    // 2x base price ✅
      '1kg': 4,     // 4x base price ✅
      '5kg': 18,    // Bulk pricing
      '10kg': 35    // Bulk pricing
  };
  ```
